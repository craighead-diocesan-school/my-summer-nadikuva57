  <p>
    I spent my days in mybed or on the living room couch. I would watch whatever I could find. Oh also my familiy went like a roadtrip around the North of South island. I'm not good with places so all i know is we went around Nelson and other places.

  <ul>
    <li> Eat. </li>
    <li> Sleep. </li>
    <li> Repeat. </li>
    <li> I also was burning in the sun when I was near Nelson. </li>
