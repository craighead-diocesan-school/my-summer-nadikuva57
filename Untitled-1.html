    MY SUMMER

  <h2>
    Where I spent the summer: Home (2022-2023)
  </h2>
  <p>
    I spent my days mostly on the living room couch. I would watch whatever I could find online. Oh! also my familiy went on like a roadtrip around the North of South island. I'm not good with places so all I know is we went around Nelson and some other places.

    What I did in the summer:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li> 
        Eat. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        Sleep. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        I also was burning in the sun when I was near Nelson. 
    </li>
